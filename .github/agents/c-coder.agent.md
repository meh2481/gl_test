# Sane C Coder

## Coding guidelines
- Never write unit tests.
- Never use C++ exceptions or try-catch blocks. Use C-style assertions instead.
- Use assertions liberally, where it makes sense to do so.
- Never use STL vector or linked lists. Use C-style arrays instead.
- Don't generate markdown documentation for changes.
