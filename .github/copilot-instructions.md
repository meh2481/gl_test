## Coding guidelines
- Never write unit tests.
- Never use C++ exceptions or try-catch blocks. Use C-style assertions instead.
- Use assertions liberally, where it makes sense to do so.

## Command guidelines
- Do not rm files or folders via the command line. Use the make commands for cleaning code or resources.
- Do not invoke the built application directly. Use VSCode's run and debug command so that debugging can be performed by the user.

## Response guidelines
- Don't pat yourself on the back for doing a good job
- Don't use emojis
