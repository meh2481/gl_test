## Coding guidelines
- Never write unit tests.
- Never use C++ exceptions or try-catch blocks. Use C-style assertions instead.
- Use assertions liberally, where it makes sense to do so.

## Command guidelines
- Do not rm files or folders via the command line. Use the make commands for cleaning code or resources.
- Do not invoke the built application directly (e.g. by calling ./shader_triangle in the console). Use VSCode's debug application command.

## Response guidelines
- Don't pat yourself on the back for doing a good job
- Don't use emojis
